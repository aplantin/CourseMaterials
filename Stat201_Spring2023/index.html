<p>Statistics is the art and science of using data to learn something about the world. It’s a science since we’ll use well-developed tools to help us examine our data – you will learn ways to explore data (with graphics and numerical summaries) and to formally test whether the differences we see in our sample are big enough to convince us that they exist in the population (this is called statistical inference). It’s an art since there are human decisions everywhere, and no two statisticians will make exactly the same decisions – you’ll learn what to look for and develop an “eye” for the judgment calls that are necessary in statistics. The goal of statistics is to learn something true about the world using our data and to appropriately evaluate data-based claims that we find in the media or in our individual fields of study.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Assignments and Evaluation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assignments-and-evaluation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Homework (15% + 5% = 20%)
<ul>
<li>Homework assignments are due Wednesdays at midnight. All homework should be submitted on Gradescope (see Glow for details).</li>
<li>
<strong>Regular Questions (15%)</strong>: The majority of each assignment will be “regular” questions. You are encouraged to work with classmates on these questions – just make sure the write-up you submit is your own (so don’t copy any text or chunks of R code directly).</li>
<li>
<strong>Solo Questions (5%)</strong>: The last question on most homework assignments will be designated a solo question, on which you may not collaborate with your peers or TAs (but you are welcome to ask me questions).</li>
<li>Late work: Life happens! You have three free “One-Day-Late” passes to use during the semester, which allow you to turn in that assignment by Thursday at midnight. I will also drop your lowest homework grade. No late work will be accepted after the one-day-late deadline.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Check-Your-Understanding Quizzes (10%)
<ul>
<li>There will be one or a few short Glow quizzes each week (broken up by textbook chapter) to check your understanding of the week’s material. They will be available Friday at 10am through Monday at 8am. You have 3 tries to improve your score on the quiz and your lowest quiz grade will be dropped.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Midterms (15% + 20% = 35%)
<ul>
<li>The two in-class midterms are tentatively scheduled for Thursday 3/9 and Thursday 4/20, in the evening. The better of your two midterms will be worth 20% of your final grade, and the lower score will be worth 15%. You may choose between the 6:15-7:45 and 7:15-8:45 time slots.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Final Exam (25%)
<ul>
<li>The final exam will be an in-class, cumulative exam, with some emphasis on the material covered since the last midterm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mini-Project (5%)
<ul>
<li>In place of the last homework assignment, you will apply your newly developed skills on a data set that is important and meaningful to you. You will work on your projects in groups of 3-4 students. You will perform a descriptive and inferential analysis and write up a short “news report” about your findings. More details will be provided as the assignment gets closer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attendance and Participation (5%)
<ul>
<li>Engaging with the class is vital to your learning. Participation will look different for different students, but I expect you to be attentive; contribute to class, small group, and/or online discussions; identify questions you have based on lectures and homework; and seek ways to get those questions answered (by peers, TAs, or me).</li>
</ul>

</h3>
<p><strong>Classroom Climate</strong>: I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities or expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability - and other visible and non-visible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class. If you have any concerns about classroom climate, please come to me to share your concern. Also, you deserve to be addressed in the manner that you prefer. If you want to be addressed with a particular name and/or pronoun, please let me know!</p>
<p><strong>Access and Accommodation</strong>: I am committed to supporting the learning of all students in my class. If you have already registered with the Office of Accessible Education and have a letter of accommodations, please share that with me early in the semester. If you have or think you have a disability (learning, sensory, physical, chronic health, mental health, or attentional), but you haven’t been in contact with OAE yet, please reach out to them at oaestaff@williams.edu – they are a great resource to ensure access and reasonable accommodations.</p>
<p><strong>Time Management</strong>: Following college guidelines, in addition to the 2.5 hours we spend together during our class meeting time, you should expect to spend (on average) 10 hours per week on the academic and creative work related to class. If you find that you are spending considerably more (or considerably less!) time to engage with this course academically, please contact me so that we can determine the best course of action as you approach the materials – we may be able to identify study strategies or skills that could support your success in this class while also helping manage the amount of time required.</p>
<p><strong>Title IX</strong>: Williams College is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students that is free of all forms of discrimination and sexual harassment, including sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or experiences any of these incidents, know that you are not alone. Williams has staff members trained to support you in navigating campus life, accessing health and counseling services, providing academic and housing accommodations, helping with legal protective orders, and more. Additional information and resources, including confidential resources, are available at: <a href="http://titleix.williams.edu/support-and-accommodation/support-and-assistance-" class="uri">http://titleix.williams.edu/support-and-accommodation/support-and-assistance-</a> for-students/. Please be aware that all Williams faculty members are responsible employees. That means that if you tell me about a situation involving sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking, I must share that information with the Title IX Coordinator. Although I have to make that notification, you will control how your case will be handled, including whether or not you wish to pursue a formal complaint. Our goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of options available to you and have access to the resources you need.</p>

</h3>
<p><strong>Make (Regular) Time</strong>: You will be asked to think, compute, and write in this class. You will run into bugs in your code and practice the skill of troubleshooting. Start your homework early so that you have the opportunity to ask questions in office hours – and so that concepts have time to percolate!</p>
<p><strong>Learn By Practicing</strong>: Research on how people learn shows that trying to remember or work through something is much better for your learning than just re-reading it – even if you get it wrong at first! Some ways you can incorporate this into your studying:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work through examples on your own first: When you read the textbook, try to work the examples by yourself, then compare what you did to the book’s process and solution.</li>
<li>Test yourself: You can do this with flash cards for key concepts and definitions, practice problems, or even talking about what we did in class with classmates or friends (or a parent/grandparent – whoever will listen!). Fun fact: even <em>unsuccessfully</em> or <em>incorrectly</em> practicing recalling the material helps your brain strengthen the connections to it! Just make sure you look up the right answers later.</li>
<li>Try in-class activities, book problems, or other practice materials without referring to your notes first – then go back and check your work.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Read the Book</strong>: The textbook is a great resource, containing additional explanations of course concepts and an abundance of exercises. Re-read sections that were challenging for you and work through problems both on your own and with your classmates.</p>
<p><strong>Ask Questions!</strong> You are always welcome (and encouraged!) to ask questions during class. Outside of class, you have a variety of options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend TA sessions: TAs hold regular sessions where students work together on homework or course content and TAs are available to answer questions.</li>
<li>Come see me: You can come to my office hours, sign up for an appointment, or stop by and see if I’m available. If the door is open, you are welcome to drop in.</li>
<li>E-mail me: I reply to emails within 24 hours M-F (and usually sooner, and usually on weekends – but always within 24 hours M-F).</li>
<li>Get a tutor: As a Williams student, you can use the free tutoring services provided by the Peer Academic Support network. Step-by-step instructions for finding and scheduling tutoring sessions (drop-in or one-on-one) are on the Peer Academic Support webpage. If you have questions about tutoring at Williams, please email msrc@williams.edu.</li>
